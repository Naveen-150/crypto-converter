- Lightweight and easy to deploy on **Akash Network**.
- **CI/CD automation with GitHub Actions** for seamless deployment.

## Technologies Used
- **Backend**: Flask (Python)
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **API**: CoinGecko API
- **Deployment**: Akash Network
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions & Docker

## Installation & Setup
### Prerequisites
Ensure you have Python installed (>= 3.7).

### Clone the Repository
```sh
git clone https://github.com/Naveen-150/crypto-converter.git
cd crypto-converter
```

  "converted_amount": 14.32
}
```

## Deployment on Akash Network
### 1. Create Deployment YAML (`deploy.yaml`)
Define resources, services, and environment variables needed for Akash deployment.

### 2. Submit Deployment to Akash
Use the Akash Console or CLI to submit and deploy the service:
```sh
akash tx deployment create deploy.yaml --from your_wallet
```
Monitor your deployment and ensure the service is running.

##  CI/CD Automation with GitHub Actions
This project includes **GitHub Actions** for automated deployment:
- When code is pushed to the `main` branch, GitHub Actions:
  1. **Builds a Docker image** and pushes it to **Docker Hub**.
  2. **Deploys the latest image** to **Akash Network** automatically.

### âš™ Setting Up GitHub Actions
To enable CI/CD, add the following **GitHub Secrets**:
- `DOCKER_USER` â€“ Your Docker Hub username.
- `DOCKER_PASSWORD` â€“ Your Docker Hub password.
- `AKASH_WALLET` â€“ Your Akash wallet address.
- `AKASH_KEY` â€“ Your Akash wallet private key.
## Testing CI/CD Automation
Make a small change (e.g., update README.md or a small CSS change).
Push the change to GitHub:
sh
    Copy
    Edit
    git add .
    git commit -m "Testing CI/CD automation"
    git push origin main
##Go to GitHub Actions in your repo:
Navigate to GitHub â†’ Your Repo â†’ Actions
You should see the deployment workflow running.
